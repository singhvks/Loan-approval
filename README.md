Checking the maximum performance that can be achieved from a single tree.

## Steps
1. Cleaning and missing data treatment
2. Performing exploratory data anaysis
3. Feture selection
4. Hyperparameter tuning using GridsearchCV
5. Evaluating metrics

## Improvements
1. Using ensemble techniques like Random Forest and adaboost
2. Using PCA and LDA 
3. Cluster analysis for exploratory data analysis
